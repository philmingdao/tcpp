Team Communication Principles and Practices


# Team Communication Principles and Practices

## Open Communication

Transparency is a core value. We encourage open communication across departments and levels. Unless confidentiality or defamation is involved, communication should be as open as possible. 

We advocate:
- Sharing work updates in company-wide channels
- Communicating progress through public group chats
- Using open-mic formats to voice updates

Factual communication is always welcome. Opinions may also be shared publicly as long as they are clearly framed as personal viewpoints.

## Diligent Updates

We promote the habit of proactively updating colleagues. Use status posts, task updates, schedules, or app logs to keep others informed of progress, challenges, and next steps.

Frequent updates reduce the need for status checks and help surface problems early—like a "Team Radio" for workflow transparency and accountability.

## Diligent Responses

Team members should respond promptly to requests and questions. While execution timelines depend on task complexity and workload, an initial reply should be given quickly.

Response rate and speed are key metrics in evaluating responsiveness.

This does not mean accepting all tasks without prioritization. Members should assess urgency and communicate plans clearly. Follow the same transparency principle: respond in visible channels so everyone stays informed.

## Raising Communication Quality

### Lead with Purpose

Clarity of intent prevents misalignment. Always state the “why”:

- Task: explain the intended outcome
- Requirement: clarify the problem it solves
- Request: specify urgency and deadline
- Policy: define the goal and problem it addresses

Purpose-driven communication leads to smarter collaboration and reduces mechanical, context-blind execution.

### Use Clear, Concrete Language

Use plain language. Avoid abstract jargon. Be specific:

- Say: “Finalize prototype by next Wednesday”
- Don’t say: “Complete initial design soon”

Only use terms when you’re sure they’re well-understood. Ambiguity leads to miscommunication, poor results, and delays.

### Structure Written Messages

Use logical, numbered sections and spacing for longer texts. Write with hierarchy and clarity. Make it easy to read.

### Use Visual Aids

For complex topics, support your message with simple diagrams or flowcharts. Keep them focused—avoid decorative graphics.

## Emotional Tone in Communication

Poor tone—intentional or not—undermines effectiveness. Avoid:

- Exclamation marks or ALL CAPS in writing
- Loud voices or profanity in speech
- Personal attacks or public shaming
- Forcing agreement or rushing to conclusions

Instead, use emotionally intelligent techniques:

- Adapt to personality types—be encouraging to sensitive, introverted, or new employees
- Express appreciation: “Thanks for the update” or “Well done”
- Use “I feel...” instead of “You always...” to give feedback

## Task Discipline

Tasks should be the standard vehicle for tracking, documenting, and discussing work—whether in specialized tools or collaboration suites.

Every task should include:
- Task name
- Purpose and expected results
- Priority
- Deadline
- Single owner
- Participants
- Subtasks (if needed)

Participants should:
- Record progress
- Raise issues
- Plan next actions
- Attach related files

Build strong task habits: review lists regularly, set priorities, and maintain a clean backlog. Refer to GTD (Getting Things Done) practices.

## Meeting Discipline

Meetings are time-intensive and used for alignment, rapid coordination, and group learning. Most are hybrid by nature.

### The 5-Minute Rule

Hosts must be ready 5 minutes early. Online meetings should be launched, and physical ones attended on time. All participants should arrive at least 2 minutes ahead.

### Host Responsibilities

Hosts must:
- Send invites and prep materials in advance
- Control meeting flow and stay purpose-driven
- Summarize action items post-meeting

Encourage meaningful input and guide discussions toward actionable outcomes. Online hosts must proactively manage turn-taking and acknowledge responses to avoid “silent meetings.”

### Muting and Focus

In large meetings, mute when not speaking, but respond promptly when addressed (within 3 seconds). Stay fully engaged. If you step away, leave a message and check back in.

## Daily Report Standards

- All staff must post daily updates tagged with `#TodayWork`
- Reports must be substantive and specific (not vague or repetitive)
- Use the structure: Progress, Problem, Plan
- Exclude confidential information
- Don’t repeat work already posted via updates
- Feel free to include personal reflections
- Managers must monitor submissions

Repeated failure to submit reports will lead to loss of monthly bonuses. Continued failure after warnings may result in termination.

### Departmental Reporting Focus

#### Sales & Service
- Client/partner activities
- Sales challenges
- Cross-team support needs

#### Marketing
- Research and results on channels/methods
- Campaign progress and outcomes
- Design/material updates
- External coordination notes

#### Operations
- Exception handling
- Rule and material updates
- Observed enablement needs

#### Product, R&D, QA, DevOps
- Research and design progress
- Defect reviews and improvements
- Team coordination efforts
- Competitive product research
- Tech stack decisions
- Feature post-launch reviews
- Deployment planning and incident analysis

#### Customer Support
- Ticket volume and backlog
- Case studies worth sharing (with links)
- Product issues discovered during support
- New/updated help materials (with links)

#### Admin, Finance, HR
Though repetitive tasks are common in these roles, daily reports should highlight anomalies, root causes, improvements, and cross-functional alerts.
